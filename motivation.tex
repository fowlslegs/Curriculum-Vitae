Please find enclosed my résumé in response to the advertisements on your website concerning the \textit{Scala} and \textit{Java} developer vacancies.

I am currently working on my Bsc. thesis in the in the \textsc{Haute École d'Ingénierie et de Gestion Vaud} (HEIG-VD). As a school that values practice and projects without neglecting theory, it gave me a considerable amount of experience as a \textbf{Java} developer.

In the \textsc{École Polythechnique Fédérale de Lausanne} (EPFL), I discovered \textbf{Scala} under the wing of Martin \textsc{Odersky}, its creator. Having previously programmed in \textit{Haskell}, I found such a mixture of object-oriented and functional paradigms in the same language was very refreshing and inspirational.

Later, I further developed my Scala skills in my current school, where I learnt and developed projects for the \textit{Play framework} and \textit{Apache Spark}.

While reading your job description, I quickly recognized myself in the mentioned values: solving \textit{complex and interesting} challenges, writing \textit{elegant} code and sharing knowledge and skills with a team. Ordina's modern idea of a workplace looks engaging: open offices, ``people over rules'' and agile methodologies are values that are really motivating, and I am very confident that I can fit in perfectly.

You will find me to be a hard working person, for whom programming is not only a job but a passion. I love to solve challenges, to design effective solutions, and consider myself to be a good communicator and team player.

I will be moving to the Netherlands by the end of the year to live with my companion in the city of Utrecht, and it is her father, Raymond \textsc{De Riel}, currently working at Ordina as a consultant, that referred me to you.

Programming aside, one of my hobbies is to learn languages. In particular, I chose Japanese as my fifth language, and intend to follow Dutch classes after moving.

If this brief account of my competencies intrigues you enough to invite me for an interview, then feel free to contact me at your earliest convenience.
